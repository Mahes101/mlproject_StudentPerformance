### End to End ML projects

Project Title
[Student Performance Analysis and Prediction]

Overview
### 1) Problem statement
- This project understands how the student's performance (test scores) is affected by other variables such as Gender, Ethnicity, Parental level of education, Lunch and Test preparation course.

Dataset
Describe the dataset used, including where it can be obtained and its structure.

Source: [ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams?datasetId=74977]

Description: The data consists of 8 column and 1000 rows.
- gender : sex of students  -> (Male/female)
- race/ethnicity : ethnicity of students -> (Group A, B,C, D,E)
- parental level of education : parents' final education ->(bachelor's degree,some college,master's degree,associate's degree,high school)
- lunch : having lunch before test (standard or free/reduced) 
- test preparation course : complete or not complete before test
- math score
- reading score
- writing score
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploring Data ( Visualization )
Visualize average score distribution to make some conclusion. 
- Histogram
- Kernel Distribution Function (KDE)
# Example code snippet for EDA
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Plot some graphs
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.hist(data['feature_column'])
plt.show()
- Student's Performance is related with lunch, race, parental level education
- Females lead in pass percentage and also are top-scorers
- Student's Performance is not much related with test preparation course
- Finishing preparation course is benefitial.
Feature Engineering
Explain the feature engineering steps taken, including any new features created and data transformations applied.

Model Building
Detail the model(s) built, the algorithms used, and the hyperparameters chosen.

# Example code snippet for model building
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Split the data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Model Evaluation
Discuss how the model was evaluated, including any metrics used and the results obtained.

# Example code snippet for model evaluation
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
Deployment
Outline the steps taken to deploy the model, including any tools or platforms used (e.g., Flask, Docker, AWS).

Usage
Provide instructions on how to use the project, including any scripts or commands to run.

bash

Copy
# Example command to run the project
python run_model.py
